  <h1>MOMO</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p><strong>Momos</strong> are basically stuffed dumplings and is the most popular snack
    from Nepal. Itâ€™s also very similar to the Japanese <strong>Gyoza</strong> 
    (pan-fried dumplings) or <strong>Pierogi</strong> which is from 
    Central/Eastern Europe. Momo is a type of steamed dumpling with some form
    of filling. Momo has become a traditional delicacy in Nepal, Tibet, as
    well as among Nepalese and Tibetan communities in Bhutan, as well as 
    people of Ladakh, Northeast India and Darjeeling regions of India.There
    are typically two types of momo, steamed and fried. Momo is usually
    served with a dipping sauce (locally called chutney/achhar), normally 
    made with tomato as the base ingredient. Soup momo is a dish with 
    steamed momo immersed in a meat or vegetable broth. Pan-fried momo is also
    known as <em>kothey momo</em>. Steamed momo served in hot sauce is called 
    <em>C-momo</em>.</p>
